# Med Pharma 

This is my Final Year Odd Semester project. "Med Pharma" is an E-Commerce demo website where people can buy their necessary medicine from online. This site is not exist in reality, just a demo.

To view this website you can [Click](https://tajnur007.github.io/med-pharma/) here or [Visit Med Pharma](https://tajnur007.github.io/med-pharma/).

To implement this website, I have used following technologies:
  - HTML/HTML5
  - CSS/CSS3 (without framework)
  - JavaScript (without framework)

This website is not responsive. So, designs can be broken in smaller devices e.g. Mobile, Tablet. To view actual design, I recommended you to view this website in Desktop Computeror Laptop.
